# MinecraftBedrockServerSetup

This Repo contains mods that are used in the minecraft bedrock server that are created by me as. Additionally it will have links to other mod packs that are used inside of the server. The main Idea of this code base is to make it as simple as possible to replicate the code base from development into production.
